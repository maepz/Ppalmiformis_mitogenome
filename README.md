This reperory holds the supplementary data for the P. palmiformis mitogenome reference paper:

Perez M, Wang H, Angers B, and Qian P-Y (2022). Complete mitochondrial genome of Paralvinella palmiformis (Polychaeta: Alvinellidae). Mitochondrial DNA Part B 7(5): 786â€“788. doi : 10.1080/23802359.2022.2071652

gene_alignments folder:
Multiple sequence alignments for 6 alvinellid species. Mitochondrial gene sequences from a supplemantary P. palmiformis individual and from the species A. caudata, A. pompejana, P. fijiensis, P. grasslei, and P. pandorae, were recovered from transcriptomic data (Fontanillas et al. 2017; Stiller et al. 2020) by assembling the mitochondrial bins of their respective transcriptomes with Trinity and SPAdes.
